irssi-mqtt-sailfish
===================

Sailfish client for receiving (irssi) notifications over MQTT


irssi-notification-client.py
----------------------------
A quick proof of concept implementation in python. Needs python-mqtt.
Only shows pop up and puts the notification in memory, no audio or haptic feedback.
